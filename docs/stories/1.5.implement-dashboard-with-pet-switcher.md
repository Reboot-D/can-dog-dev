# Story 1.5: Implement Dashboard with Pet Switcher

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user with multiple pets,
**I want** a dashboard with a pet switcher,
**so that** I can easily select which pet's information I am currently viewing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main dashboard page displays a list of the logged-in user's pets.
2. Clicking on a pet's name sets it as the "active pet".
3. The UI clearly indicates which pet is active.
4. If a user has no pets, a message in Simplified Chinese prompts them to add one.

- Pet management system is fully functional with CRUD operations for pets
- Pets API endpoints (GET /api/pets, POST /api/pets) are implemented and tested
- PetsList and AddPetForm components are available and working with Chinese localization
- Zustand state management already established for authentication - can extend for pets
- Testing framework (Jest/RTL/Playwright) configured and working properly
- Chinese localization framework ready with messages/zh-CN.json for text management
- Pets service layer (/lib/pets/pets-service.ts) available for client-side data access

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with TypeScript ~5.4 - Type-safe frontend development
- **State Management:** Zustand ~4.5 - Simple state management for active pet selection
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui latest - Pre-built, accessible UI components for switcher
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 - Utility-first styling for pet switcher UI
- **Testing:** Jest/RTL latest + Playwright ~1.44 - Comprehensive testing strategy

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Pet Model Attributes:** id, created_at, user_id, name, breed, date_of_birth, photo_url
- **Pet Relationships:** Belongs to one User, has many Journal Entries, has many Events
- **Active Pet Selection:** Need to manage which pet is currently selected for viewing

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md and Story 1.4 completion]
- **GET /api/pets:** Already implemented - retrieve all pets for authenticated user
- **Authentication:** All endpoints require Supabase session validation (already working)
- **Data Access:** Use existing pets service layer for fetching pet data

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Organization:** Structure using /ui, /features, and /layouts folders
- **State Management:** Zustand for simple global state (extend for active pet management)
- **Routing:** Next.js App Router with middleware protection already configured
- **Services:** Typed data-access layer already available for pets (/lib/pets/pets-service.ts)

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: Story 1.4 completion and established patterns]
- **Pet Components:** /apps/web/src/components/pets/ for new PetSwitcher component
- **State Management:** /apps/web/src/store/ for pets store (following auth store pattern)
- **Dashboard Integration:** /apps/web/src/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx updates
- **Reusable Components:** Leverage existing /components/ui/ components for switcher UI
- **Service Layer:** Use existing /lib/pets/pets-service.ts for data fetching

### Localization Integration
[Source: Story 1.2-1.4 completion]
- **Messages File:** Extend /apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json with pet switcher translations
- **Translation Hook:** Use useTranslations hook for all pet switcher UI text
- **Route Structure:** Follow [locale] pattern established in previous stories
- **Chinese Messages:** All switcher UI, empty states, and messages must be in Simplified Chinese

### State Management Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md and Story 1.3 patterns]
- **Zustand Store:** Create pets store similar to auth store pattern
- **Persistence:** Use localStorage for persisting active pet selection across sessions
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage for pet selection state and actions
- **Integration:** Ensure pets store works seamlessly with existing auth store

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md and Story 1.4 patterns]
- **Unit Tests:** Jest tests for pets store state management and pet selection logic
- **Component Tests:** Jest/RTL tests for PetSwitcher component and user interactions
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright tests for complete pet switching workflow and persistence
- **Test Location:** Colocate test files with components following established patterns
- **Localization Testing:** Verify Chinese text display and empty state handling in switcher

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Pyramid:** Unit (Jest/RTL), Integration, and E2E (Playwright) tests required
- **Test File Location:** Colocate test files with components (__tests__ subdirectories)
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Specific Requirements for this Story:**
  - State management testing for pets store and active pet selection
  - Component interaction testing for pet switcher clicks and active states
  - E2E testing for complete pet switching workflow including persistence
  - Chinese localization testing for all switcher UI elements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with well-structured components, comprehensive state management, and thorough testing coverage. The PetSwitcher component follows React best practices with proper separation of concerns, error handling, and accessibility considerations. The Zustand store implementation is robust with proper validation and persistence handling. Overall code quality is high with consistent patterns and clean architecture.

### Refactoring Performed

I performed several strategic refactorings to improve code quality and maintainability:

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/pets/pet-switcher.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese text with proper translation keys
  - **Why**: Hardcoded text violates internationalization best practices and makes maintenance difficult
  - **How**: Used proper `t('pets.switcher.count', { count: pets.length })` pattern for parameterized translations

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/pets/pet-switcher.tsx`
  - **Change**: Extracted magic numbers and values to constants at module level
  - **Why**: Magic numbers scattered throughout code reduce maintainability and readability
  - **How**: Created `MAX_PET_NAME_DISPLAY_WIDTH`, `AVATAR_SIZE`, and `ICON_SIZE` constants for better code organization

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/pets/pet-switcher.tsx`
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling with specific error message types
  - **Why**: Generic error messages provide poor user experience
  - **How**: Added network-specific error detection and corresponding user-friendly messages

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json`
  - **Change**: Added missing translation key for network errors
  - **Why**: Error handling improvement required new translation key for completeness
  - **How**: Added `networkError` key with appropriate Chinese translation

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/pets/pet-switcher.tsx`
  - **Change**: Optimized performance with useCallback for event handlers
  - **Why**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and improves component performance
  - **How**: Wrapped `loadPets` and `handlePetSelect` with useCallback with proper dependencies

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to React and TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect alignment with established folder structure and patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage including unit, component, and E2E tests
