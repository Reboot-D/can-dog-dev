# Story 1.3: User Authentication

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to be able to sign up for an account, log in, and log out,
**so that** I can access the application's features securely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Sign Up" page and a "Login" page are created.
2. Users can successfully register an account, which creates a user in Supabase Auth.
3. Registered users can successfully log in and are redirected to the dashboard.
4. Logged-in users can log out.
5. Dashboard routes are protected from unauthenticated users.
6. All UI text on these pages is in Simplified Chinese.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 Dev Agent Record]
- Next.js 14.2 with App Router and next-intl successfully configured for Chinese localization
- Middleware.ts already exists for locale handling - needs extension for auth protection
- Established component structure in /apps/web/src/app/[locale]/ following App Router patterns
- Chinese localization framework ready with messages/zh-CN.json for text management
- Testing framework (Jest/RTL) configured and working with localization tests

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth latest - Manages user sign-up, login, sessions
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 - Primary framework for UI and API
- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript ~5.4 - Type safety for the frontend
- **State Management:** Zustand ~4.5 - Simple, lightweight state management
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest / RTL latest - Unit and component testing
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright ~1.44 - End-to-end testing of user flows

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **User data:** Managed by Supabase Auth automatically
- **Pet relationships:** Pets belong to one User via user_id foreign key
- **Journal Entry relationships:** Entries belong to one User via user_id foreign key
- **Event relationships:** Events belong to one User via user_id foreign key

### Database Schema and Security
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- PostgreSQL DDL includes **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** for all tables
- Users can only access their own data through RLS enforcement
- All tables use user_id foreign key relationships for data isolation

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions via Next.js API Route Handlers
- **Data Access:** Dedicated service layer (/packages/services) to interact with Supabase
- **Authentication:** Server-side session validation on every secure API request
- Auth handlers should be implemented as API routes in /apps/web/src/app/api/auth/

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Organization:** Structure using /ui, /features, and /layouts folders
- **State Management:** Zustand for simple global state (use for auth state)
- **Routing:** Next.js App Router with middleware for protected routes
- **Services:** Typed data-access layer for communicating with the backend API

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: Story 1.2 completion and architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Auth pages:** /apps/web/src/app/[locale]/auth/signup/page.tsx, /apps/web/src/app/[locale]/auth/login/page.tsx
- **Dashboard:** /apps/web/src/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx (protected route)
- **API routes:** /apps/web/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts, /apps/web/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts
- **Components:** /apps/web/src/components/ui/ for reusable auth form components
- **Services:** /apps/web/src/lib/auth/ for auth utilities and Supabase client setup
- **Middleware:** Extend existing /apps/web/src/middleware.ts for route protection

### Localization Integration
[Source: Story 1.2 completion and architecture]
- **Messages file:** Extend /apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json with auth-related translations
- **Component structure:** Use useTranslations hook for all text in auth components
- **Route structure:** Follow [locale] pattern established in previous story
- **Error messages:** All validation and auth errors must be in Simplified Chinese

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md and backend-architecture.md]
- **Session validation:** Server-side session validation on secure API requests
- **Route protection:** Middleware-based protection for dashboard routes
- **Type safety:** Full TypeScript coverage for auth functions and components
- **Error handling:** Secure error messages that don't expose system internals

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest/RTL for unit and component testing
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright for end-to-end testing of user flows
- **Test Coverage:** Testing pyramid with Unit, Integration, and E2E tests
- **Test Location:** Colocate test files with components following established patterns
- Test files should verify Chinese localization, auth flows, and protected route access

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The authentication implementation demonstrates solid foundational work with proper use of Next.js 14, Supabase Auth, and internationalization. The developer successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with comprehensive testing. However, during senior code review, I identified several areas for improvement related to code architecture, validation, and maintainability.

The implementation follows the established project structure and properly integrates with the existing localization framework. The testing strategy is comprehensive with unit, integration, and E2E tests all passing.

### Refactoring Performed

As a senior developer review, I performed significant refactoring to improve code quality and maintainability:
