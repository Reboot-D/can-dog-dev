# Story 1.7: Update & Delete Pet Profiles

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,

**so that** I can keep their information accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can access "Edit" and "Delete" functions for their pets.
2. The "Edit" form is pre-populated and successfully updates the pet's record in Supabase.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.4-1.6 Dev Agent Record]
- Pets service (PetsService) already includes updatePet() and deletePet() methods in /lib/pets/pets-service.ts
- PetsList component exists with pet display functionality but lacks edit/delete actions
- Pet data types (Pet, PetInsert) are defined in /types/supabase.ts  
- Chinese localization framework operational with useTranslations hook and messages/zh-CN.json
- Component testing patterns established with Jest/RTL and E2E testing with Playwright
- Pets store (Zustand) manages active pet state with localStorage persistence

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 with TypeScript ~5.4 - Type-safe frontend development
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui latest - Pre-built, accessible UI components for dialogs and forms
- **State Management:** Zustand ~4.5 - Integration with existing pets store for active pet management
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 - Utility-first styling for edit/delete UI elements
- **Testing:** Jest/RTL latest + Playwright ~1.44 - Comprehensive testing strategy

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Pet Model Attributes:** id, created_at, user_id, name, breed, date_of_birth, photo_url
- **Pet Relationships:** Belongs to one User, has many Journal Entries, has many Events
- **Update Operations:** All pet attributes except id, created_at, user_id can be modified
- **Delete Operations:** Cascade delete consideration for related journal entries and events

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- **Pets API:** PUT /api/pets/[petId] for updates, DELETE /api/pets/[petId] for deletion
- **Authentication:** All endpoints require Supabase session validation (established pattern)
- **Service Layer:** Use existing PetsService methods updatePet() and deletePet()
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling for network failures and validation errors

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Organization:** Structure using /ui, /features, and /layouts folders
- **State Management:** Integrate with existing Zustand pets store for active pet management
- **Services:** Use existing typed pets-service layer for data operations
- **Form Management:** Implement proper form validation and error handling

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: unified-project-structure.md and existing implementation]
- **Pet Components:** /apps/web/src/components/pets/ for new EditPetDialog and ConfirmDeleteDialog
- **Service Layer:** Use existing /apps/web/src/lib/pets/pets-service.ts methods
- **UI Components:** Leverage existing /components/ui/ components for dialogs and forms
- **State Integration:** Use existing pets store for active pet context and list refresh
- **Pets List Updates:** Modify existing /apps/web/src/components/pets/pets-list.tsx

### Localization Integration
[Source: Story 1.2-1.6 completion]
- **Messages File:** Extend /apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json with edit/delete translations
- **Translation Hook:** Use useTranslations hook for all edit/delete UI text
- **Chinese Messages:** All dialogs, forms, confirmations, and error messages must be in Simplified Chinese
- **Existing Patterns:** Follow established translation patterns from pets list component

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md and established patterns]
- **Dialog Components:** Use Shadcn/ui Dialog component for edit and delete confirmations
- **Form Components:** Use Shadcn/ui Form components with proper validation
- **Action Integration:** Seamlessly integrate edit/delete actions into existing pets list
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure proper mobile experience for action buttons and dialogs

### Service Layer Integration
[Source: existing pets-service.ts implementation]
- **Update Method:** updatePet(petId: string, petData: Partial<Omit<PetInsert, 'user_id'>>): Promise<Pet>
- **Delete Method:** deletePet(petId: string): Promise<void>
- **Error Handling:** Both methods include proper error handling with descriptive messages
- **Authentication:** Service automatically handles user authentication for RLS policies

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Pyramid:** Unit (Jest/RTL), Integration, and E2E (Playwright) tests required
- **Test File Location:** Colocate test files with components following established patterns
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Specific Requirements for this Story:**
  - Dialog component testing for edit/delete functionality
  - Form validation testing for edit pet dialog
  - Service layer testing for update/delete operations with error scenarios
  - E2E testing for complete edit/delete workflows including confirmation flows
  - Chinese localization testing for all new UI elements

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall implementation quality is excellent with proper React component architecture, comprehensive form validation, error handling, and security measures. The code demonstrates good separation of concerns and follows established patterns in the codebase. Chinese localization is properly implemented throughout all UI elements.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/ui/form-input.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed potential XSS vulnerability in inputId generation
  - **Why**: The regex `/\s+/g` only removed spaces but allowed special characters that could cause XSS
  - **How**: Changed to `/[^a-z0-9]/g` to only allow alphanumeric characters in DOM IDs

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows React best practices and TypeScript conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in /components/pets/ with proper file structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests now passing with proper mocks and translation handling
- All ACs Met: ✓ Edit, delete, and confirmation dialog requirements fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed security vulnerability in FormInput component ID generation
[x] Fix unit test translation mocks to resolve test failures
[x] Resolve TypeScript build error in events-service.ts (outside scope but blocking build)
[ ] Consider adding optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
[ ] Consider adding undo functionality for accidental deletions

### Security Review

✓ Fixed XSS vulnerability in form input ID generation
✓ Pet ownership validation properly implemented in service layer  
✓ Authentication checks in place for all pet operations
✓ No sensitive data exposed in client-side code

### Performance Considerations

The current implementation performs well with proper state management and refresh mechanisms. The refreshTrigger pattern ensures UI consistency after edit/delete operations.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - All issues resolved, tests passing, build successful
