# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Supabase Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the monorepo project structure to be initialized with Next.js and connected to Supabase,
**so that** I have a foundational environment to start building features

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The monorepo structure is created.
2. A new Next.js with TypeScript application is scaffolded inside the `/apps/web` directory.
3. The Supabase client is installed and configured.
4. A basic test connection to Supabase is successful.
5. A simple page can be successfully deployed to Vercel.

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
The monorepo structure should follow this layout:
```
petcare-ai/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                    # The Next.js full-stack application
│       ├── /public/            # Static assets
│       └── /src/
│           ├── /app/           # Next.js App Router
│           ├── /components/    # React components
│           ├── /lib/           # Helper functions & utilities
│           └── /stores/        # Zustand state management stores
├── packages/
│   ├── /config/               # Shared configurations
│   ├── /services/             # Backend Data Access Layer
│   └── /shared-types/         # Shared TypeScript interfaces
├── docs/
├── package.json               # Root package.json for the monorepo
└── turbo.json                # Turborepo configuration
```

### Supabase Client Setup
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Create Supabase client in `/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- The client will be used for authentication and data access
- Environment variables needed:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Serverless Architecture:** Using Vercel Functions for backend logic
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Offloading core functionality to Supabase
- **Component-Based UI:** Using React and Next.js
- **Platform:** Vercel for deployment

### Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- Testing framework: Jest / React Testing Library (latest)
- Test file location: Colocated with components
- No specific testing requirements for this initialization story

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality.** The monorepo structure is properly configured with Turborepo, TypeScript configurations are consistent across packages, and the Supabase integration follows best practices with proper error handling and environment variable management. The code demonstrates good architectural patterns and separation of concerns.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/packages/config/tsconfig.json` (created)
  - **Change**: Added proper TypeScript configuration with Node.js types
  - **Why**: The original setup was missing TypeScript configurations causing build failures
  - **How**: Configured proper compiler options and included @types/node for environment access

- **File**: `/packages/shared-types/tsconfig.json` (created)
  - **Change**: Added TypeScript configuration for shared types package
  - **Why**: Build process required proper TypeScript compilation setup
  - **How**: Standard TypeScript config with declaration output for package consumption

- **File**: `/packages/services/tsconfig.json` (created)
  - **Change**: Added TypeScript configuration for services package
  - **Why**: Consistent build configuration across all packages
  - **How**: Matching configuration with other packages for consistency

- **File**: `/packages/config/package.json` (modified)
  - **Change**: Added @types/node dependency
  - **Why**: TypeScript compiler required Node.js type definitions for process.env access
  - **How**: Added as dev dependency to resolve compilation errors

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (modified)
  - **Change**: Improved HealthStatus interface with strict typing
  - **Why**: Better type safety and consistency with API response structure
  - **How**: Changed from generic string types to union types with specific values

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ No ESLint warnings or errors, proper TypeScript usage
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Follows specified monorepo structure with proper separation
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Basic health check testing implemented, ready for unit test expansion
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed missing TypeScript configurations for all packages
- [x] Resolved Node.js type dependencies for environment variable access
- [x] Improved type safety in React components with proper interfaces
- [x] Verified build process works correctly across all packages
- [x] Validated Supabase client configuration and health check functionality
- [x] Ensured proper monorepo structure with Turborepo integration
- [x] Confirmed environment variable handling follows security best practices

### Security Review

**Secure implementation.** Environment variables are properly handled with fallback values for build-time safety. No sensitive data is exposed in the client-side code. The Supabase client uses public keys appropriately, and the health check endpoint includes proper error handling without exposing internal system details.

### Performance Considerations

**Well-optimized setup.** Next.js build produces efficient static pages with good First Load JS metrics (87.9 kB total). Turborepo caching is properly configured for faster subsequent builds. The health check endpoint is lightweight and doesn't create unnecessary database overhead.

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation exceeds expectations with proper architecture, excellent error handling, and production-ready configuration. The monorepo structure is well-organized and scalable for future development. All acceptance criteria are met with high code quality standards.
