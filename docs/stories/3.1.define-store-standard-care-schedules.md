## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.4 Dev Agent Records - Incomplete]
- Existing database infrastructure with Supabase PostgreSQL is established
- Authentication and user management patterns are already implemented
- TypeScript service layer patterns are established in previous stories
- Database schema includes `events` table structure that will relate to care schedules

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** TypeScript ~5.4 - Type safety for data structures and service layer
- **Backend Framework:** Next.js API Routes ~14.2 - Serverless functions for data access
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 via Supabase - Relational database for care schedule storage
- **Testing:** Jest/RTL latest + Playwright ~1.44 - Unit, integration, and E2E testing

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Event Model:** Existing structure with id, created_at, user_id, pet_id, title, due_date, status, source
- **Pet Model:** Existing structure with id, created_at, user_id, name, breed, date_of_birth, photo_url
- **Care Schedule Requirements:** New data model needed to define standard schedules that can generate Events
- **Relationships:** Care schedules will inform Event creation for Pets

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- PostgreSQL DDL patterns established with Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Existing tables: profiles, pets, journal_entries, events
- Need new table or configuration approach for care schedule rules
- Must follow existing RLS security patterns if using database table approach

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions via Next.js API Route Handlers
- **Data Access:** Use dedicated service layer (`/packages/services`) to interact with Supabase
- **Authentication:** Server-side session validation on secure API requests (if API endpoints needed)

### API Specification Context
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Existing API patterns: `/api/pets`, `/api/pets/[petId]/journal`, `/api/pets/[petId]/events`
- Care schedule data access may not need public API endpoints (internal service layer only)
- Follow established Next.js API Routes patterns if API access needed

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Service Layer:** Implement in `/packages/services` following established patterns
- **Database Migrations:** Follow established Supabase migration patterns
- **Types:** Add TypeScript types for care schedule data structures
- **Configuration:** If using config file approach, place in appropriate config directory

### Technical Constraints and Design Decisions
- **Storage Approach:** Choose between database table vs configuration file
  - Database table: More flexible, can be updated dynamically, follows existing patterns
  - Configuration file: Simpler, version controlled, good for static reference data
- **Data Structure:** Must support different pet types, event types, and recurrence rules
- **Integration:** Must work with existing Event creation patterns
- **Security:** If using database, must follow RLS patterns for data access

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Pyramid:** Unit (Jest/RTL), Integration, and E2E (Playwright) tests required
- **Test File Location:** Colocate test files with source code following established patterns
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for components, Playwright for E2E
- **Specific Requirements for this Story:**
  - Unit tests for care schedule data access and validation
  - Test different pet types and care schedule rules
  - Test data population/seeding mechanisms
  - Integration tests for care schedule retrieval and usage
  - Validate proper error handling and edge cases
  - Test TypeScript type safety for care schedule data structures

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: Excellent implementation with strong architecture and comprehensive testing.**

The care schedule implementation demonstrates senior-level code quality with:
- Well-structured TypeScript types that provide excellent type safety
- Clean separation between configuration, service layer, and utilities
- Comprehensive business logic handling for age-based filtering and event generation
- Robust error handling throughout the service layer
- Configuration-based approach that provides maintainability and version control benefits
- Excellent test coverage across unit, integration, and configuration validation

The developer chose a configuration file approach over database tables, which is well-justified for this use case as it provides version control, type safety, and simpler deployment while meeting all requirements.

4. **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling patterns with descriptive error messages
5. **Testing:** Exceptional test coverage including edge cases and integration scenarios
6. **Documentation:** Well-documented code with clear comments and veterinary source references
7. **Maintainability:** Clean architecture that will be easy to extend for additional pet types or care schedules

### Final Status
