## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 3.2 - Implement Automated Event Creation Logic]
- Event creation logic implemented as a reusable function that takes pet_id
- Events table exists with proper schema and RLS policies
- CareScheduleService from Story 3.1 provides event generation capabilities
- Event creation function handles duplicate prevention and error handling

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** TypeScript ~5.4 - Type safety for cron job handlers
- **Backend Framework:** Next.js API Routes ~14.2 - Serverless functions for cron job endpoint
- **CI/CD:** Vercel CI/CD - Supports native cron job configuration
- **Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics - Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions via Next.js API Route Handlers
- **Data Access:** Use dedicated service layer (`/packages/services`) for database operations
- **Authentication:** Cron jobs should verify they are triggered by Vercel platform

### Vercel Cron Job Configuration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns]
- Vercel Cron Jobs trigger serverless functions for scheduled tasks
- Cron jobs are configured via vercel.json in the project root
- Cron job endpoints should be protected from external access

### API Route Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **API Routes:** Place cron job endpoint in `/apps/web/src/pages/api/` structure
- **Naming Convention:** Consider using `/api/cron/` prefix for all cron job endpoints
- **File Location:** Create endpoint at `/apps/web/src/pages/api/cron/daily-event-generation.ts`

### Cron Schedule Configuration
- **Timing:** Daily at UTC+8 (which is 00:00 UTC or use "0 16 * * *" for 00:00 Beijing time)
- **Vercel Config:** Add cron configuration to vercel.json
- **Example Configuration:**
  ```json
  {
    "crons": [{
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-event-generation",
      "schedule": "0 16 * * *"
    }]
  }
  ```

### Logging Requirements
- **Success Logging:** Log number of pets processed, events created, execution time
- **Failure Logging:** Log specific errors, failed pet IDs, stack traces
- **Monitoring:** Leverage Vercel's built-in logging accessible via dashboard
- **Log Format:** Structured JSON logs for easy parsing and monitoring

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** Verify CRON_SECRET environment variable from Vercel
- **Rate Limiting:** Cron endpoints should reject requests not from Vercel
- **Error Exposure:** Never expose sensitive data in error logs
- **Database Access:** Use proper connection pooling for batch operations

### Integration with Story 3.2
- Import event creation service from Story 3.2
- Call the automated event creation function for each active pet
- Handle batch processing efficiently to avoid timeouts
- Consider pagination if pet count grows large

### Technical Constraints
- **Execution Time:** Vercel functions have timeout limits (default 10s, max 5min)
- **Memory Limits:** Consider memory usage when processing many pets
- **Cold Starts:** First execution may be slower due to cold start
- **Idempotency:** Ensure multiple executions don't create duplicate events

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Pyramid:** Unit (Jest/RTL), Integration, and E2E (Playwright) tests required
- **Test File Location:** Colocate test files with source code
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Specific Requirements for this Story:**
  - Unit tests for cron job handler function
  - Integration tests for database batch operations
  - Test cron job authentication mechanism
  - Test logging output format and content
  - Test error scenarios (database failures, timeout handling)
  - Test with varying numbers of pets (0, 1, many)
  - Verify idempotency of cron job execution
  - Manual testing procedure for verifying cron job configuration on Vercel
