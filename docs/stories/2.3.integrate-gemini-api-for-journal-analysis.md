# Story 2.3: Integrate Gemini API for Journal Analysis

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my new journal entry to be analyzed by the pet care AI when I save it,
**so that** I can receive helpful insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Vercel serverless function is created to securely call the Gemini API.
2. When a new journal entry is saved, the frontend calls this function.
3. The prompt to Gemini instructs it to act as a cautious, non-veterinary pet care advisor and respond in Simplified Chinese.
4. The UI displays a loading indicator.

- Input validation prevents malicious data from reaching external APIs
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- User can only analyze their own pets' journal entries

### Performance Considerations

Performance approach is appropriate:
- Analysis runs asynchronously after entry creation for better UX
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse (60 requests/hour)
- Caching of analysis results prevents duplicate requests
- Loading states provide good user feedback
- Error states don't block core journal entry functionality

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and demonstrates good software engineering practices. The critical language requirement has been corrected, and several code quality improvements have been made. The build and lint processes pass successfully, indicating the refactored code maintains system integrity.
