### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural patterns and follows established conventions well. The component structure is clean, uses proper TypeScript typing, and integrates seamlessly with existing systems. The code shows good separation of concerns with a dedicated service layer, custom hook for state management, and reusable UI components.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/lib/events/events-service.ts`
  - **Change**: Improved type safety in updateEvent method to preserve existing pet_id/user_id values
  - **Why**: Prevents accidental data loss when partial updates are performed
  - **How**: Changed fallback logic from empty strings to preserving existing event properties

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/lib/events/use-upcoming-event.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling with more descriptive error messages
