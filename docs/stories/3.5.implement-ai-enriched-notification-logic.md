# Story 3.5: Implement AI-Enriched Notification Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to receive a smart, personalized email notification for my pet's upcoming events,
**so that** I get helpful context and tips.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A daily scheduled task checks for events due within a specific timeframe.
2. For each event, the system sends context (pet name, breed, event) to the Gemini API.
3. The prompt asks for a friendly reminder and a relevant tip, in Simplified Chinese.
4. The AI-generated content is used as the email body and sent via the Resend service.
5. The system prevents sending duplicate notifications.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** TypeScript ~5.4 - Type safety for notification service
- **Backend Framework:** Next.js API Routes ~14.2 - Serverless functions for cron jobs and notifications
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 via Supabase - Event and notification tracking
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API - Content generation for notifications
- **Email Service:** Resend API - Email delivery (already integrated in Story 3.4)
- **CI/CD:** Vercel CI/CD - Environment variable management and deployment
- **Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics - Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions via Next.js API Route Handlers
- **Data Access:** Use dedicated service layer (`/packages/services`) for external API operations
- **Authentication:** Server-side session validation on secure API requests (internal cron jobs may not require auth)

### External API Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- **Google Gemini API:** Provides AI analysis and content generation
- **Resend API:** Already integrated in Story 3.4 for sending transactional emails
- API integrations should follow established patterns for external service connections

### Data Model Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Event Model:** id, created_at, user_id, pet_id, title, due_date, status, source
- **Pet Model:** id, created_at, user_id, name, breed, date_of_birth, photo_url
- **Database Schema:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own data

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Monorepo structure with `/apps` and `/packages` organization
- Services should be placed in `/packages/services` directory
- API routes in `/apps/web/src/app/api/` structure (App Router)
- Cron jobs should be placed in `/apps/web/src/app/api/cron/` directory

### Notification Logic Implementation Details
- **Cron Job Endpoint:** Create at `/apps/web/src/app/api/cron/check-notifications/route.ts`
- **Notification Service:** Create in `/packages/services/notification-service.ts`
- **AI Content Service:** Create in `/packages/services/ai-content-service.ts` 
- **Environment Variables:** Use existing GEMINI_API_KEY and RESEND_API_KEY from previous stories
- **Database Operations:** Query events table for upcoming events, track notification status
- **Timeframe Configuration:** Check for events due within 24-48 hours (configurable)
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures and network issues
- **Logging:** Use structured logging for notification processing and debugging

### Chinese Language Support Requirements
- **AI Prompt Design:** Craft prompts that instruct Gemini to respond in Simplified Chinese
- **Email Templates:** Ensure email templates properly render Chinese characters
- **Character Encoding:** Maintain UTF-8 encoding throughout the notification pipeline
- **Cultural Context:** AI prompts should consider Chinese cultural context for pet care advice

### Notification Tracking and Deduplication
- **Tracking Strategy:** Add notification_sent_at timestamp to events table or create separate notifications table
- **Deduplication Logic:** Check existing notification records before sending
- **Status Management:** Track notification delivery status and handle failures
- **Database Indexes:** Add indexes on user_id, due_date, and notification_sent_at for efficient querying

### Integration Points
- **Email Service:** Leverage existing EmailService from Story 3.4 with Chinese template support
- **Event System:** Build on event creation logic from Stories 3.1 and 3.2
- **AI Integration:** Use similar patterns from Story 2.3 Gemini API integration
- **Cron Architecture:** Build on scheduled task patterns from Story 3.3

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Protection:** Secure storage of GEMINI_API_KEY in environment variables
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for Gemini API calls
- **Input Validation:** Validate event and pet data before sending to AI APIs
- **Authentication:** Protect cron endpoints appropriately (internal use)
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure pet data is handled securely in AI API calls

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md and Story 3.4]
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit tests, RTL for component testing, Playwright for E2E
- **Test File Location:** Colocate test files with source code using `__tests__` directories
- **Mock Strategy:** Mock external APIs (Gemini, Resend) in test environment
- **Specific Requirements for this Story:**
  - Unit tests for notification scheduling and filtering logic
  - Unit tests for AI content generation service
  - Integration tests for complete notification workflow
  - Mock Gemini API responses for consistent testing
  - Test notification deduplication and tracking

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation demonstrating senior-level architecture and comprehensive feature integration.** The notification system shows sophisticated design patterns with proper service layering, robust error handling, and intelligent AI integration. The Chinese language support is well-implemented with proper UTF-8 encoding and culturally appropriate content generation. The cron job implementation follows enterprise-level patterns with comprehensive logging and graceful failure handling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/packages/services/notification-service.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed Supabase query to use profiles table instead of auth.users for user data access
  - **Why**: The auth.users table access pattern was causing TypeScript compilation errors
  - **How**: Updated query to use `user:profiles(email, full_name)` and adjusted data transformation accordingly

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/app/api/cron/check-notifications/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Removed unused Event type import
  - **Why**: ESLint was flagging unused import, affecting code quality standards
  - **How**: Cleaned up import statement to only include necessary types

- **File**: `/packages/services/email-templates.ts`
  - **Change**: Removed duplicate createAINotificationEmailTemplate function definition
  - **Why**: TypeScript compiler was failing due to duplicate function declarations
  - **How**: Identified and removed the second duplicate function implementation

- **File**: Test files in `/apps/web/src/app/api/cron/check-notifications/__tests__/route.test.ts` and email tests
  - **Change**: Fixed TypeScript any types to proper typing with jest.Mocked<T> and Record<string, unknown>
  - **Why**: ESLint was flagging explicit any usage, violating code quality standards
  - **How**: Applied proper TypeScript generics and interface definitions for test mocking

- **File**: `/packages/services/package.json`
  - **Change**: Added missing @google/generative-ai dependency and fixed build output paths
  - **Why**: Missing dependency was causing compilation failures in AI content service
  - **How**: Added dependency to package.json and corrected main/types paths to point to compiled output
