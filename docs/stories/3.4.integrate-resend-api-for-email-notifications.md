### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions via Next.js API Route Handlers
- **Data Access:** Use dedicated service layer (`/packages/services`) for external API operations
- **Authentication:** Server-side session validation on every secure API request

### External API Integration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- **Resend API:** Sends all transactional emails
- API integration should follow established patterns for external service connections

### High-Level Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Platform:** Vercel serverless functions for backend logic
- **Key Services:** Resend API identified as core service for email functionality
- **Serverless Architecture:** Using Vercel Functions for all backend logic
- **API Layer:** Securely handling backend logic via Next.js API Routes

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Monorepo structure with `/apps` and `/packages` organization
- Services should be placed in `/packages/services` directory
- API routes in `/apps/web/src/pages/api/` structure

### Email Service Implementation Details
- **Package Installation:** Install `resend` npm package in appropriate workspace
- **Service Location:** Create email service in `/packages/services/email-service.ts`
- **API Endpoint:** Create endpoint at `/apps/web/src/pages/api/email/send.ts`
- **Environment Variables:** Store RESEND_API_KEY securely in Vercel environment
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures
- **Logging:** Use structured logging for email sending operations
- **Authentication:** Protect email sending endpoint from unauthorized access

### Chinese Language Support
- **Character Encoding:** Ensure UTF-8 encoding for Chinese characters
- **Email Templates:** Design templates that support Simplified Chinese text
- **Testing:** Validate Chinese character display in email clients
- **Content Validation:** Ensure proper rendering of Chinese text in HTML emails

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Protection:** Never expose RESEND_API_KEY in client-side code
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for email sending endpoints
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all email parameters
- **Authentication:** Ensure only authorized services can trigger email sending
- **Monitoring:** Log email sending attempts for security monitoring

### Integration Points
- **Future Story 3.5:** This email service will be used by AI-enriched notification logic
- **Cron Jobs:** Email service will be called by scheduled tasks for automated notifications
- **User Notifications:** Service should support various email types (notifications, alerts, etc.)
