### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md and existing patterns]
- **Journal Components:** Extend existing components in `/apps/web/src/components/journal/`
- **UI Components:** Use Shadcn/ui components from `/apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- **Localization:** Extend `/apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json` with additional translations
- **Testing:** Follow colocated test pattern in `__tests__` subdirectories
- **Types:** Extend existing types that may be needed for AI advice display

### Component Specifications
[Source: established patterns from Story 2.1-2.3]

- **Journal History:** Components for displaying journal entries exist
- **Loading States:** Established patterns for loading indicators with Chinese text
- **Error Handling:** Established patterns for user-friendly Chinese error messages
- **Styling:** Consistent with existing journal entry styling and Tailwind CSS patterns

### Localization Requirements
[Source: Story 1.2 completion and established patterns]
- All UI text must be in Simplified Chinese

- Required translation keys:
  - AI assistant section label ("AI護理建議")
  - Error messages for AI analysis failures
  - Loading states for AI advice
  - Empty/no advice states

### Security and Performance Considerations
[Source: established security patterns]
- AI advice content should be sanitized before display (already handled by Gemini API)
- Ensure no sensitive information is displayed in error messages
- Optimize rendering performance for multiple journal entries with AI advice
- Handle graceful degradation when AI advice is not available

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Pyramid:** Unit tests for components, integration tests for workflows, E2E for user flows
- **Test Location:** Colocate tests in `__tests__` subdirectories
- **Frameworks:** Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for components, Playwright for E2E
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test AI advice display with various content lengths
  - Test error state handling and error message display
  - Test empty/null AI advice state handling
  - Test Chinese localization for all display states
  - E2E test complete flow from journal entry to AI advice display
  - Test responsive design for AI advice display section

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **high-quality senior-level code** with comprehensive Chinese localization, robust error handling, and excellent test coverage. The AI advice display functionality is well-architected and follows established project patterns. The developer has successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with attention to edge cases and user experience.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: /apps/web/src/components/journal/journal-entry-form.tsx
  - **Change**: Extracted AIAnalysisResult component for better separation of concerns
  - **Why**: The main component was handling too many responsibilities; extracting the analysis result display improves maintainability and readability
  - **How**: Created dedicated component with proper TypeScript interface, cleaner conditional styling logic

- **File**: /apps/web/src/components/journal/journal-entry-form.tsx  
  - **Change**: Replaced hard-coded emoji with accessible SVG icon
  - **Why**: Hard-coded emojis are not accessible and can render inconsistently across platforms
  - **How**: Added proper SVG icon with aria-hidden attribute for better accessibility

- **File**: /apps/web/src/components/journal/journal-entry-form.tsx
  - **Change**: Added configuration constants for magic numbers
  - **Why**: Hard-coded values like timeout and retry delays should be configurable
  - **How**: Defined SUCCESS_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT and AI_ANALYSIS_RETRY_DELAY constants at module level

- **File**: /apps/web/src/components/journal/journal-history.tsx
  - **Change**: Improved ellipsis character usage
  - **Why**: Using proper Unicode ellipsis character (…) instead of three dots improves typography
  - **How**: Replaced '...' with '\u2026' in content truncation

- **File**: /apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json
  - **Change**: Added accessibility translations for screen readers
  - **Why**: Missing accessibility labels for AI assistant icon and loading states
  - **How**: Added "accessibility" section with appropriate Chinese translations

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ **Excellent** - TypeScript types properly used, consistent naming conventions, proper error handling patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **Compliant** - Files properly located in established directory structure, service layer correctly utilized
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ **Comprehensive** - Unit tests cover all scenarios including AI analysis functionality, error states, and edge cases
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ **Fully Implemented** - All acceptance criteria successfully delivered with excellent attention to detail

### Improvements Checklist
