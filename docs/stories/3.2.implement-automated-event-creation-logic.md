# Story 3.2: Implement Automated Event Creation Logic

## Status  
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a function that analyzes a pet's profile against the standard care schedules,
**so that** it can create necessary future events.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An `events` table is created in the Supabase database.
2. A reusable function takes a `pet_id`, reads the pet's data, compares it against the standard schedules, and creates new records in the `events` table.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create events table in Supabase database (AC: 1)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Design events table schema with required columns (id, created_at, user_id, pet_id, title, due_date, status, source)
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create database migration for events table
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Apply Row Level Security (RLS) policies for events table
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Verify table creation and RLS policies work correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 3.1 Dev Agent Records]
- Care schedule configuration system is implemented with dog/cat schedules
- CareScheduleService provides CRUD operations and event generation capabilities
- Care schedule data structure supports different event types and recurrence rules
- Configuration file approach used (more maintainable than database table)
- TypeScript types established for care schedules and generated events

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** TypeScript ~5.4 - Type safety for service layer and database operations
- **Backend Framework:** Next.js API Routes ~14.2 - Serverless functions for event creation API
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 via Supabase - Relational database for events storage
- **Testing:** Jest/RTL latest + Playwright ~1.44 - Unit, integration, and E2E testing

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **Event Model:** id, created_at, user_id, pet_id, title, due_date, status, source
- **Pet Model:** id, created_at, user_id, name, breed, date_of_birth, photo_url
- **Relationships:** Events belong to one User and one Pet
- **Integration:** Events will be generated based on Pet data and Care Schedules from Story 3.1

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- PostgreSQL DDL patterns established with Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Existing tables: profiles, pets, journal_entries (events table needs to be created)
- Must follow existing RLS security patterns to ensure users can only access their own events
- Events table schema must align with existing Event data model structure

### Backend Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions via Next.js API Route Handlers
- **Data Access:** Use dedicated service layer (`/packages/services`) to interact with Supabase
- **Authentication:** Server-side session validation on secure API requests for event creation

### API Specification Context
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Existing API patterns: `/api/pets`, `/api/pets/[petId]/journal`, `/api/pets/[petId]/events`
- Follow established Next.js API Routes patterns for new event creation endpoints
- Events API already defined: GET /api/pets/[petId]/events, PUT /api/events/[eventId]
- May need new POST endpoint for automated event creation: POST /api/pets/[petId]/events/generate

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Service Layer:** Implement event creation logic in `/packages/services` following established patterns
- **Database Migrations:** Follow established Supabase migration patterns for events table
- **Types:** Add TypeScript types for event creation in appropriate type files
- **API Routes:** Place new API endpoints in `/apps/web/src/pages/api/` structure

### Integration with Care Schedules (Story 3.1)
- Use CareScheduleService from Story 3.1 to access care schedule configuration
- Event creation algorithm must interpret care schedule rules and recurrence patterns
- Generate events based on pet's age, breed, and existing event history
- Ensure generated events align with care schedule recommendations
- Source field in events should reference the care schedule rule used for generation

### Technical Constraints and Design Decisions
- **Event Generation Logic:** Must be reusable function that can be called from multiple contexts
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Avoid creating duplicate events for the same care schedule rule
- **Performance:** Efficient database queries when checking existing events
- **Security:** All event creation must respect user ownership and RLS policies
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of missing pet data or care schedule issues

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Pyramid:** Unit (Jest/RTL), Integration, and E2E (Playwright) tests required
- **Test File Location:** Colocate test files with source code following established patterns
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for components, Playwright for E2E
- **Specific Requirements for this Story:**
  - Unit tests for event creation service functions and algorithm logic
  - Integration tests for database operations and care schedule integration
  - API endpoint tests with proper authentication and authorization
  - Test edge cases: no pet data, missing care schedules, duplicate events
  - Test different pet types and care schedule scenarios
  - Validate proper error handling and logging
  - Test TypeScript type safety for event creation data structures
  - E2E tests for complete automated event creation workflow
