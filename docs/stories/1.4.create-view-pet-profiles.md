### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

The implementation demonstrates high-quality, production-ready code with proper architecture patterns, comprehensive error handling, and excellent test coverage. The developer has successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with thoughtful attention to user experience, security, and maintainability.

**Key Strengths:**
- Robust database schema with proper RLS policies for data isolation
- Well-structured API endpoints with comprehensive validation and error handling
- Clean component architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Excellent TypeScript coverage and type safety
- Comprehensive test suite covering unit, component, and E2E scenarios
- Proper localization implementation throughout the UI

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `/apps/web/src/components/pets/pets-list.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese text with proper localization keys
- **Why**: Hardcoded text breaks the established localization pattern and makes maintenance difficult
- **How**: Extracted age calculation text (`小于1个月`, `X个月`, `X岁`) and pet count text into proper translation keys with parameter interpolation

**File**: `/apps/web/src/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese text with localization keys
- **Why**: Dashboard contained hardcoded Chinese text that violated the established localization pattern
- **How**: Extracted welcome message and quick actions section into proper translation keys in the localization file

**File**: `/apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json`
- **Change**: Added missing translation keys for refactored components
- **Why**: New translation keys were needed to support the refactored localization
- **How**: Added dashboard section, pet count keys, and age calculation keys with proper parameter support

**File**: `/apps/web/src/components/pets/__tests__/pets-list.test.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated test messages to match refactored localization keys
- **Why**: Tests were failing due to updated translation keys
- **How**: Added missing translation keys in test mock messages

**File**: `/apps/web/e2e/pet-management.spec.ts`
- **Change**: Fixed pet count assertion text
- **Why**: Test assertion didn't match the actual rendered text format
- **How**: Updated expectation from `2 个宠物` to `2个宠物` to match actual rendering
