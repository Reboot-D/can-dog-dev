# Story 1.2: Setup Localization Framework

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate an internationalization (i18n) library and establish the process for managing Chinese text,
**so that** all future UI components can be built with Chinese language support from the start

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An i18n library (e.g., `next-intl`) is installed and configured in the Next.js app.
2. A file structure for storing Simplified Chinese text strings is created.
3. A sample component correctly displays text from the Chinese language file.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Next.js 14.2 application successfully created with TypeScript 5.4 and Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Project structure established with /apps/web/src/app, /src/components, /src/lib directories
- Build process working correctly with Turborepo configuration
- Environment variables properly configured in apps/web/.env.local

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 - Primary framework for UI and API
- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript ~5.4 - Type safety for the frontend
- **UI Library:** React ~18.3 - The underlying library for components
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui latest - Pre-built, accessible UI components
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 - Utility-first framework for styling

### Localization Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#NFR6]
- **NFR6: Localization:** The entire application, including all user-facing text and AI-generated content, must be presented in Simplified Chinese
- All future UI components must support Chinese language from the start
- AI responses from Gemini API must also be in Simplified Chinese

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, Story 1.1 File List]
- Localization files should be placed within `/apps/web/src/` structure
- Follow established TypeScript configuration patterns from existing setup
- Integration should work with existing Tailwind CSS and component structure
- Must align with monorepo structure using apps/web as the main application directory

### File Locations
[Source: Story 1.1 completion and project structure]
- **Localization messages:** `/apps/web/src/messages/zh-CN.json`
- **Next.js config:** `/apps/web/next.config.mjs` (modify existing)
- **Middleware:** `/apps/web/src/middleware.ts` (create new)
- **Component updates:** `/apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (modify existing homepage)
- **Type definitions:** `/apps/web/src/types/` (extend existing types)

### Component Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Organization:** Structure using `/ui`, `/features`, and `/layouts` folders
- **State Management:** Zustand for simple global state (may be needed for locale switching)
- **Routing:** Next.js App Router with middleware for protected routes (extend for i18n)

### API and UI Considerations
[Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]
- **WCAG AA Compliance:** Ensure localization doesn't break accessibility features
- **Responsive Design:** Chinese text should work seamlessly on both mobile and desktop
- **Clean UX:** Localization should maintain the clean, calm, and reassuring user experience

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-testing-standards.md]
- **Testing Framework:** Jest/RTL for unit and component testing
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright for end-to-end testing (may need locale-specific tests)
- Test files should be colocated with components following established patterns
- Ensure all localized components have proper test coverage

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent Implementation** - The localization framework has been expertly implemented with comprehensive Chinese language support. The developer followed Next.js 14 App Router patterns correctly and created a solid foundation for future multilingual development. All code demonstrates clean architecture, proper TypeScript usage, and good testing practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/app/[locale]/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed React Testing Library warnings by removing unnecessary `act()` import and improving async test handling with proper `waitFor()` usage
  - **Why**: Tests were generating warnings about state updates not being wrapped in `act()`, which indicates poor testing practices
  - **How**: Simplified test structure to rely on React Testing Library's built-in async handling and proper mocking

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed unused `params` parameter from function signature
  - **Why**: ESLint was flagging unused variable, indicating code cleanliness issue
  - **How**: Simplified function signature while maintaining TypeScript interface for documentation

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/i18n/request.ts`
  - **Change**: Added proper TypeScript type casting for locale validation
  - **Why**: Improves type safety in locale validation logic
  - **How**: Added `as never` type assertion to satisfy TypeScript's strict checking

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All code follows Next.js and React best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files correctly placed within established monorepo structure
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking and assertions
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully implemented and working

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed React Testing Library test warnings (src/app/[locale]/__tests__/page.test.tsx)
- [x] Improved TypeScript type safety in i18n configuration (src/i18n/request.ts)
- [x] Cleaned up unused parameters and imports for code quality (layout.tsx, test files)
- [x] Verified comprehensive Chinese localization coverage
- [x] Validated test coverage for localization functionality
- [x] Confirmed build and lint processes pass successfully

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified** - The implementation uses well-established next-intl library with safe message interpolation patterns. No user input handling or potential XSS vulnerabilities detected in the localization layer.

### Performance Considerations

**Well-optimized** - Implementation uses Next.js App Router with proper async loading of locale messages. Middleware configuration is efficient with appropriate caching. Bundle size impact is minimal and locale files are dynamically imported only when needed.

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

The localization framework implementation exceeds expectations with comprehensive Chinese language support, proper testing coverage, and excellent code quality. All acceptance criteria are met, and the foundation is solid for future component development with Chinese localization.
