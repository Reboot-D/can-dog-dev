# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-07-27
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** User

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** An AI-powered, multi-user web application for pet care.

**Session Goals:** To define a "simple and elegant" Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a personal pet care assistant that can be shared among friends.

**Techniques Used:** Progressive Flow, What If Scenarios, Feature Listing & Prioritization.

**Total Ideas Generated:** The session resulted in a core list of 8 features that define the MVP.

**Key Themes Identified:**
- **Simplicity:** The application should be simple, elegant, and avoid "fancy but useless" features.
- **Automation:** Core value comes from the AI automatically generating schedules and providing insights.
- **Cautious Advice:** The AI personality should be that of a helpful, cautious advisor, not an alarmist or a simple data logger.
- **Multi-Pet Focus:** The UI must intuitively support users with multiple pets.

## Technique Sessions

We utilized a "What If Scenarios" technique to explore key concepts:

-   **Scenario 1: A user with multiple pets.** The solution was to create a "pet switcher" on the main dashboard to filter information for a selected pet. The most important information to show after switching is the "Next Upcoming Event."
-   **Scenario 2: A user enters a concerning journal entry ("limping").** The solution was for the AI to provide immediate, cautious advice (e.g., "Keep an eye on her and consider a shorter walk tomorrow"), establishing its role as a helpful advisor.

## Idea Categorization: The MVP Feature Set

The following 8 features were identified and confirmed as the scope for the MVP:

1.  **User Accounts:** A system for users to sign up and log in.
2.  **Pet Profiles:** The ability for each user to add and manage one or more pets.
3.  **Dashboard with Pet Switcher:** The main view where a user can select which pet's information to display.
4.  **"Next Event" Display:** The most prominent information on the dashboard, showing the next time-sensitive task.
5.  **Daily Journal:** A simple input for users to write daily notes about their pets.
6.  **AI Advisor:** The Gemini integration that analyzes journal entries and provides cautious advice.
7.  **Automated Scheduler:** A background process that analyzes a pet's profile to automatically create future events.
8.  **Notifications:** A system to send reminders to the user via email (using Resend).

## Action Planning

### Top Priority Features (The "First Use" Experience)

The following features were prioritized as the first logical slice of development to provide a complete onboarding and initial value experience for a new user:

1.  **User Accounts:** The foundational step for any user.
2.  **Pet Profiles:** The core data entry needed for the app to function.
3.  **"Next Event" Display:** The first piece of immediate, tangible value the user sees.
4.  **AI Advisor:** The primary "smart" feature that demonstrates the app's unique value proposition.

### Next Steps

The clear next step is to use this document as the primary input to create a formal **Project Brief**. This will add more structure around the business goals, user personas, and success metrics, preparing us for the full planning and development process.

## Reflection & Follow-up

This session successfully defined the scope and priorities for a compelling MVP. The guiding principle of "simple and elegant" will be critical moving forward. The next recommended action is to formalize these findings in a Project Brief.
