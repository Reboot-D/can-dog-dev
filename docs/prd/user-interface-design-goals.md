# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience will be clean, calm, and reassuring, reflecting its purpose as a helpful personal assistant. The design will be minimalist and content-focused, prioritizing clarity and ease of use over distracting visual elements. Every interaction should feel simple, intuitive, and purposeful.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Dashboard-Centric:** The main dashboard will be the hub of the application, providing an at-a-glance summary and access to all key features.
* **Single-Pet Focus:** Although the app supports multiple pets, the UI will always focus on one pet at a time to maintain clarity.
* **Direct Input & Feedback:** Users will interact via simple forms (like the journal), and the AI's feedback will be presented clearly and immediately in the context of their input.
* **Asynchronous Notifications:** To be non-intrusive, proactive reminders will be sent via email rather than disruptive in-app pop-ups.

## Core Screens and Views

* Login / Sign Up Screen
* Main Dashboard
* Pet Profile Management Screen (Create/Edit a pet)
* Journal View (to see history)
* User Settings/Account Screen

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

* We will target **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance as a standard best practice to ensure the site is usable by as many people as possible.

## Branding

* The branding should be soft, clean, and trustworthy, using a simple color palette and a clean, legible font.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

* The application will be a responsive website, designed to work seamlessly on both mobile phone browsers and desktop computer browsers.
