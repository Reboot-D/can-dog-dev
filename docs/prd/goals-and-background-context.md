# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* To create a simple, elegant, and useful web application that acts as a personal assistant for pet care.
* To support multiple users (the user and their friends) and multiple pets per user.
* To leverage the Gemini API to automatically generate personalized care schedules (e.g., vaccinations, grooming).
* To provide cautious, AI-driven advice by analyzing user-submitted journal entries about their pet's daily condition.
* To proactively notify users of upcoming important events in their pet's schedule.

## Background Context

Many pet owners struggle to manage the complex scheduling of their pet's health and wellness needs. Remembering vaccination dates, grooming appointments, and interpreting minor day-to-day changes in a pet's behavior can be challenging.

This project aims to solve this problem by creating a centralized, intelligent platform. It will serve as a personal assistant, not a commercial product, for a close-knit group of friends. By integrating with the Gemini API, the application will provide automated, proactive, and personalized care plans, moving beyond simple reminders to offer advisory insights, helping owners take the best possible care of their beloved pets.
