# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for PetCare AI, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The project's initial frontend structure will be based on the code generated by the **v0.dev platform**, as specified in the UI/UX workflow. This provides a modern Next.js and Tailwind CSS starter template, which we will build upon and integrate with our backend services.
