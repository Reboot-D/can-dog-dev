### Overall UX Goals & Principles

**Target User Personas**
* **The Busy Owner:** Tech-savvy but short on time. They need the app to be fast, efficient, and proactive, giving them the most important information at a glance.
* **The Anxious Owner:** Cares deeply for their pet but may be a first-time owner. They need the app to be reassuring, clear, and provide gentle, trustworthy guidance.

**Usability Goals**
* **Ease of Use:** A new user should be able to sign up, add a pet, and understand the dashboard in under 3 minutes.
* **Efficiency:** Daily tasks, like adding a journal entry, should take no more than 30 seconds.
* **Clarity:** Information and AI advice must be presented without ambiguity.

**Design Principles**
1.  **Clarity Above All:** The interface must be immediately understandable.
2.  **Calm & Reassuring:** The design should reduce anxiety, not create it.
3.  **Effortless & Proactive:** The app should do the heavy lifting for the user.

## Information Architecture (IA)

### Site Map / Screen Inventory
This diagram shows the main screens and their relationships. A user would flow from the Logged Out Experience to the Logged In Experience after signing up or logging in. The main Logged In Experience consists of a Global Navigation that accesses the Main Dashboard and User Settings, as well as a Logout function. The Main Dashboard is the access point for Pet Profile Management and the Journal History.

### Navigation Structure
* **Primary Navigation:** Once logged in, primary navigation will be minimal (Dashboard, User Settings, Logout), likely accessible through a user menu.
* **Secondary Navigation:** The "Pet Switcher" on the dashboard will serve as the main contextual navigation.
* **Breadcrumb Strategy:** Breadcrumbs are not necessary for the MVP's flat architecture.

## User Flows

### User Onboarding Flow
**User Goal:** To create an account, log in, and add their first pet.

### Daily Check-in Flow
**User Goal:** To log a daily observation and receive an AI insight.

### Pet Profile Management Flow
**User Goal:** To update or delete a pet's profile.

## Wireframes & Mockups

**Primary Design Files:**
* **Mockup Tool:** Google Stitch (stitch.withgoogle.com)
* **Code Generation:** Mockups will be exported and used as input for v0.dev to generate the initial frontend code.

### Key Screen Layouts

#### Main Dashboard
* **Purpose:** At-a-glance view of important info and the primary interaction point.
* **Key Elements:** Header, Pet Switcher, "Next Upcoming Event" Card, "Daily Journal" Section, "Journal History" List.

#### Pet Profile Management (Modal)
* **Purpose:** A focused interface for adding/editing a pet without leaving the dashboard.
* **Key Elements:** Modal Title, Form Fields (Name, Breed, DOB, Photo Upload), Save/Cancel/Delete Buttons.

## Component Library / Design System

### Design System Approach
We will use a pre-existing component library. Based on the tech stack and workflow, **Shadcn/ui** is the recommended choice.

### Core Components
* **Button:** With Primary, Secondary, and Destructive variants.
* **Input Field:** With Text, Password, and Text Area variants.
* **Card:** A styled container for content sections.
* **Modal:** For overlays like the Pet Management form and confirmations.

## Branding & Style Guide

### Visual Identity
The identity should feel trustworthy, gentle, and modern.

### Color Palette
* **Primary:** #3b82f6 (Main buttons, links)
* **Secondary:** #64748b (Secondary text, borders)
* **Accent/Success:** #10b981 / #22c55e (Success states, confirmations)
* **Warning:** #f59e0b (Cautions)
* **Error:** #ef4444 (Errors, destructive actions)
* **Neutral:** A range of grays for backgrounds and text.

### Typography
* **Primary Font:** Inter.
* **Type Scale:** A standard H1-H3, Body, and Small text scale is defined.

### Iconography
* **Icon Library:** Lucide Icons.

### Spacing & Layout
* **Grid System:** An 8-point grid system will be used.

## Core Usability Standards
1.  **Readable Content:** Ensure text is always easy to read by using our color palette correctly.
2.  **Keyboard Friendliness:** Ensure every button and link can be accessed with the keyboard.
3.  **Clear Forms & Images:** Ensure all form fields are clearly labeled and pet photos have simple descriptions.

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints
* **Mobile:** (default)
* **Tablet:** 768px+
* **Desktop:** 1024px+
* **Wide:** 1280px+

### Adaptation Patterns
The layout will adapt from a single column on mobile to a multi-column grid on larger screens.

## Animation & Micro-interactions
All animations will be subtle, quick, and purposeful.

## Performance Considerations
The application will be optimized for a fast initial load (<2 seconds) and instantaneous interaction response.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1.  Final review of this document.
2.  Begin creating visual mockups in Google Stitch.
3.  Handoff this specification to the Architect for the `front-end-architecture` document.

### Design Handoff Checklist
* [x] All user flows documented
* [x] Component inventory complete
* [x] Core usability standards defined
* [x] Responsive strategy clear
* [x] Brand guidelines established
* [x] Performance goals established

## Checklist Results
A final review of this specification has been conducted. It is complete, internally consistent, and fully aligned with the project's PRD.
